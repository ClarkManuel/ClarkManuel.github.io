        <div class="text-box" data-bg="image2.jpg">Months later, I ended up buying him a friend.</div>
        <div class="text-box" data-bg="image3.jpg"> I didn’t have the most impressive collection...<br><br>But I was happy with it.</div>
        <div class="text-box" data-bg="image4.jpg">That was until I got my first premium figure.<br><br>That’s when the obsession began.</div>
        <div class="text-box" data-bg="image5.jpg">The first figure I had bought with my very first paycheck.</div>

        <div class="text-box" data-bg="image11.jpg">Because I think it’s cool to compare where I started to where I am.</div>
        <div class="text-box" data-bg="image12.jpg">I love collecting. And I plan to keep collecting till the day I die!</div>
